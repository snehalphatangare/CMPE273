What is psutil?

psutil (python system and process utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network) in Python. Requirements

Use psutil and implement a network socket monitoring tool that can check how many TCP sockets are being created by a web application.
Create a Python script called socket-mon.py.
List all processes that have any socket connections (meaning the laddr and raddr fields exist).
Group by the PID and sort the output by the number of the connections per process.

Expected Output in CSV format

$ python socket-mon.py (or $ sudo python socket-mon.py) "pid","laddr","raddr","status" "1234","10.0.0.1@48776","93.186.135.91@80","ESTABLISHED" "1234","10.0.0.1@48777","93.186.135.91@80","ESTABLISHED" "5678","10.0.0.1@48779","193.286.35.91@8000","CLOSING"

In the above output, the PID 1234 has two active connection with ESTABLISHED status and the other PID 5678 is closing one connection.

How to run a simple http server and check its process id?

Create index.html file with "Hello World" text.

$ echo "Hello World" > index.html

Run a default Python HTTP Server inside the same directory that you created "index.html"

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

By default, the SimpleHTTPServer will listen on port 8000. Check you can see the "Hello World" page.

$ curl -i http://localhost:8000/ HTTP/1.0 200 OK Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/2.7.13 Date: Wed, 08 Feb 2017 23:10:14 GMT Content-type: text/html Content-Length: 12 Last-Modified: Wed, 08 Feb 2017 23:03:11 GMT

Hello World

Now, you can check PID of your Hello World web server.

$ ps PID TTY TIME CMD 3853 ttys000 0:00.24 -bash 64140 ttys006 0:00.04 -bash 64391 ttys007 0:00.03 -bash 64837 ttys007 0:00.06 /{Depending_on_where_you_installed_python}/Python -m SimpleHTTPServer

64837 is the PID of the SimpleHTTPServer that you launched.

You can also use Apache Benchmarking tool to generate multiple TCP/Http connections on the server.
